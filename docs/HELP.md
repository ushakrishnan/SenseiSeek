## For Executives

As an executive, your goal is to find high-impact, flexible roles that match your expertise.

### Key Features
-   **Dashboard**: Your central hub to see matched opportunities, track applications, and view messages.
-   **My Profile**: This is your public-facing resume on the platform. Keep it updated to attract the best roles.
    -   **AI Rewrite**: Use the magic wand icon (<Wand2Icon />) to get AI assistance in crafting a more compelling expertise summary or STAR-method accomplishments.
    -   **Parse from Resume**: On first creating your profile, you can paste your resume text to have AI pre-fill many of the fields for you.
-   **Find Opportunities**: Browse all active roles posted by startups.
-   **Saved Opportunities**: Bookmark roles you're interested in to review later.
-   **Applications**: Track the status of all your submitted applications (Applied, In-Review, Hired, Rejected).
-   **Inbox**: Communicate directly with startups who have contacted you or with platform support.

### Understanding the AI Match Score
When you browse the "Find Opportunities" page, each role is given a Match Score. This isn't just a simple keyword search. Here's how it works:
-   **Holistic Analysis**: Our AI reads your entire profile (expertise, accomplishments, skills) and compares it against the startup's full job description (summary, deliverables, challenges).
-   **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands the context and nuance of both your profile and the role. For example, it knows that "scaling GTM for a Series B company" is a strong match for a startup that needs to "expand market share post-funding."
-   **What the Score Means**: The score is a percentage (0-100%) that represents the AI's confidence in your fit for that specific role. A higher score means a stronger alignment between your stated expertise and the startup's stated needs.
-   **It's a Guide**: The score is a powerful guide to help you focus your search, but it's not a definitive judgment. You may still be a great fit for roles with lower scores, especially if you have relevant experience not captured in your profile text.

### How to Get Help or Report an Issue
-   **Contact Support**: The best way to get help is to use the "Help & Support" button located in the sidebar of your dashboard. This creates a direct message thread with the Sensei Seek admin team, ensuring your request is tracked and handled efficiently.
-   **For General Inquiries**: If you don't have an account or can't log in, you can use the public "Contact Us" page, and your message will be routed to our support team.

### Understanding the AI Match Score
When you use "Find Talent" or review applicants, each executive is given a Match Score. This is a powerful tool to help you quickly identify the best candidates.
-   **Holistic Analysis**: The AI reads the executive's entire profile (expertise, accomplishments, skills) and compares it against your **active job needs**.
-   **Contextual Understanding**: The AI understands business context. It can connect an executive's accomplishment of "led a company through a $25M Series B" to your need for a leader experienced in "fundraising and investor relations."
-   **What the Score Means**: The score is a percentage (0-100%) representing the AI's confidence in the candidate's fit. 
    - On the **Find Talent** page, the score reflects the candidate's best match against **all** of your active roles.
    - On the **Applicants** page, the score is specific to the role they applied for.
-   **It's a Guide**: Use the score to prioritize your outreach, but also consider the candidate's full profile. The AI provides a strong signal, but human judgment is key.

### How to Get Help or Report an Issue
-   **Contact Support**: The best way to get help is to use the "Help & Support" button located in the sidebar of your dashboard. This creates a direct message thread with the Sensei Seek admin team, ensuring your request is tracked and handled efficiently.
-   **For General Inquiries**: If you don't have an account or can't log in, you can use the public "Contact Us" page, and your message will be routed to our support team.
